# Ideas Improvements 


Will end up soon in issues or feature-requests, but also are some things to be done completely offline...
Therefore dropping my brain now:



# Registered as issue 

* Support for entering more than one repair-object
* The times on the board are 15/30min/1h granularity. Should be at 5 mins
* The printout from the scrum-board was a big bottleneck. Server needs to be connected to printer and the papers directly be printed out. (Under the assumption that we need the printouts in future ...)
* We do not record the estimated waiting-time at the time of registration. Therefore we cannot compare estimation with reality
* We should have printed out number-cards for the visitors
* We need to make the excel available for download
* What about having buzzers with numbers like in fast-food restaurants?
* the CSRF-Token timeout needs to be longer.
* When we have the checkout digital, we can calc and show the repair-quote digital
* Checkout is completely missing  ==> still manual work at the end of the event 
* We can fill out the rest in the excel automatically
* The read-only board of the Kanboard needs to be intergrated via route instead of the normal board
* An auto-change route which changes between the Kanban-(read-only)-Board and the overview
* Fair scheduling-algorithm when people are entering more than one repair-object
